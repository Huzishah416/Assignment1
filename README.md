The script takes a date in the "DD-MM-YYYY" formats well as a number of days, and return the date when that number of days is applied to the date. That is, if the user enters "18-06-2020" and "7", the script will return "25-06-2020". Similarly, if the number is a negative number, the script will return a date in the past.
